# EDA_with_Excel

In this project I have tried to find patterns from the titanic dataset using the exploratory data analysis using microsoft excel.

In the dataset we have
- PassengerID
- Survived
- Pclass - Passenger Class
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked ( C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton )

We have found out many patterns and factors due to which the possibility of a passenger dying increases like gender, the passenger class seat, age, etc.

- In the above image we can see that mostly people from the age ranging from 15 to 40 years have died.

- In all condition which is gender, passenger class and embarked from, males have died atmost because of the reason ladies and children were the first priority for the evacuation.

- In this image slicers are used to filter out the desired output.
